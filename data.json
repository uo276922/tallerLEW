After the Roman invasion of the northern peninsula in Navelgas, a Roman gold mine was created on an old indigenous exploitation. The technique used was the so-called ruina montium, which consisted of accumulating large quantities of water in high places to transport it through artificial channels to the areas where the mineral was found, dissolved in the earth. The water mixed with the earth traveled great distances through these channels, leaving the gold deposited by decantation in the bends of the channel. This same system was used in many other gold mining operations in northern Hispania, such as Las Médulas (León).",
